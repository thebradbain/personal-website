    <h1>Median Income by Census Tract, Visualized</h1>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>Inspired by a politics class studying the socioeconomic divisions within
    Los Angeles both by analyzing data and exploring with feet on the ground, I
    decided to visualize the cities of California by median income using the largest
    dataset I had available: the US Census. The results were illuminatingâ€“ areas that,
    when paired with an understanding of recent context and history, show the effect
    of previous urban planning decisions and ongoing gentrification and displacement,
    in addition to the staggering income gaps in both San Francisco and Los Angeles.
