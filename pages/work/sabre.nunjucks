    <h1>Sabre Labs</h1>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>Sabre Labs is a research group focused on developing technologies to transform
    Sabre and the rest of the travel industry in the near future. Rapid prototyping,
    cutting-edge technologies, and fast iteration are the norm.</p>
    <br>
    <p>As a summer intern, I worked full time upon integrating then-emerging web technologies (React and Polymer) with
       a new web API and updating TripCase, Sabre's consumer facing mobile application built upon Ember.js.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Other experiences include giving a presentation to company executives over data mining using supervised machine learning to improve the customer
       conversion rate of promotional emails through targeted advertising, and participating in multiple focus groups on consumer-facing, white-label services.</p>
