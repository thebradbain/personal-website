    <br>
    <p>Dialexa is an end-to-end software development and external consulting startup. From launching
    in-house products and companies such as <a class="underline" href="https://www.vin.li" taget="blank">Vinli</a>, which brings a
    WiFi Hotspot and custom third party applications to any car, and <a class="underline" href="https://www.tryrobin.com" target="blank">Robin</a>,

    Dialexa has experience with web, mobile, native, hardware, and IoT.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>As an intern for two years, I joined Dialexa when the team was only 20 people, and I was there throughout their rapid growth to over 150 employees, two spin-off companies,
    and countless projects.</p>
    <br>
    <p>During my time at Dialexa, I worked on a variety of projects, including building a bridge between Vinli's hardware readings and its online API service,
    Q&A work for HiRise, a marketplace to buy and lease office space online, for real estate giant JLL, and communicating with my own client to rapidly develop and
    iterate upon the firmware for a label-less bioassay system for laboratory group Resonant Sensors.</p>
